# NLP_classifier
# Medical Transcription Classification
This project aims to classify medical transcriptions into different categories using machine learning algorithms. The following medical specialties are considered for classification:

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
Neurosurgery
ENT - Otolaryngology
Discharge Summary
Orthopedic
Gastroenterology
Three popular classifiers, namely Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, are employed for the classification task.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset of medical transcriptions, where each transcription is associated with one of the predefined medical specialties. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the classifiers.

# Dependencies
The project is implemented in Python, and the following dependencies are required:
Python (version 3.x)
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
xgboost
